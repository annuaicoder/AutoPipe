# 🚀 AutoPipe

**AutoPipe** is a blazing-fast CLI tool that auto-generates a working **GitHub Actions CI pipeline** for any public repo in seconds. No copy-pasting, no YAML headaches — just run it and go.

## 📦 What It Does

- Detects the project type (Node.js, Python, Go)
- Creates `.github/workflows/ci.yml` based on best practices
- Commits the workflow to the repo
- Leaves the push to you — safe, secure, and under your control

## ✨ Example

```bash
./autopipe.sh https://github.com/your-username/your-project
It will:

Clone the repo

Detect the project language

Generate the CI pipeline

Commit it locally

Tell you to git push when ready

🛠 Supported Languages
Language	Detected By	CI Commands
Node.js	package.json	npm install && npm test
Python	requirements.txt or manage.py	pip install + pytest
Go	main.go	go build && go test

More languages are coming soon (Rust, Java, PHP).
