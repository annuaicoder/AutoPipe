🧩 AutoPipe – Instant GitHub Actions Generator
AutoPipe is a command-line tool that automatically creates a GitHub Actions CI pipeline for any public repository in seconds.

🎯 Clone. Detect. Generate. Commit.
No YAML. No copy-pasting. No setup stress.

✨ Features
🔍 Auto-detects project type: Node.js, Python, Go (more coming!)

⚙️ Generates CI workflow for build + test steps

💬 Interactive fallback if detection fails

💾 Commits the workflow locally (you push when ready)

🔐 Works with SSH or HTTPS Git remotes

🧪 Works out of the box with npm, pytest, go test, etc.

📦 Example
bash
Copy
Edit
./autopipe.sh https://github.com/username/repo
AutoPipe will:

Clone the repo

Detect the language

Create .github/workflows/ci.yml

Commit the pipeline (you push)

🛠 Supported Languages
Language	Detected By	Pipeline Step
Node.js	package.json	npm install && npm test
Python	requirements.txt or manage.py	pip install + pytest
Go	main.go	go build && go test

🔜 Coming Soon
Support for Rust, Java, PHP

Deploy step scaffolding (e.g. Netlify, Vercel)
